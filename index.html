		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Welcome to my website! My name is Shilong and I am working in the exciting field of two-dimensional Moire materials. My research focuses on exploring the properties and potential applications of these materials, which are created by stacking two or more layers of 2D materials with a slight twist angle.</p>

		<h2>Research</h2>
		<p>My team and I are developping experimental techniques to understand the fundamental physics of Moire materials and to design new devices with enhanced functionality. We investigate the electronic band structure, excitonic properties, and spin transport in these materials, as well as their response to external stimuli such as electric and magnetic fields.</p>
		<p>Our research also involves developing new techniques for synthesizing and characterizing Moire materials, such as using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy to probe their atomic and vibrational properties. We collaborate with other researchers in academia and industry to explore potential applications of Moire materials in areas such as quantum computing, sensing, and energy conversion.</p>
